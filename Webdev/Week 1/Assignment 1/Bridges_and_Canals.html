        <h1> Tourist Information Amsterdam</h1>
        <div>
            Amsterdam, the Netherlands' capital,
             is one of the world's best hangout spots,
              a place where you can <br> immerse yourself in culture,
               history, art, in the head of a beer or a self-rolled smoke.
        </div>
        <br>

        <div>
            Amsterdam is situated 20 km from the sea,
             at the point where river Amstel joins the river IJ.
             The city has a <br> population of about 750,000 and is the country's
              second largest port - after Rotterdam. Amsterdam is at the <br> centre
               of a part of the Netherlands where there are many places of interest within easy reach.

        <h2>Amsterdam Museums</h2>
        <p>
           For a fairly small city, Amsterdam has a surprisingly large number of museums and galleries. 
          Traditional <br> art-lovers know the route to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum. But modern art 
          too is richly <br> represented in Amsterdam, with the Stedelijk Museum and the Cobra museum in Amstelveen
          to name just <br> two. There is a plenty of galleries, especially in the Spiegelkwartier and in the Jordaan.
           And if you want to <br> experience more of nature, then the gardens 
          of the universities and Artis Zoo are the right addresses. In a <br> nutshell, there are lot of 
          things to see in Amsterdam.

           <h3>Amsterdam Canals and Waterways</h3>
           <p>
            From the grace and elegance, the city's canals and waterways embody
             the very spirit of Amsterdam. They are <br> spanned by many beautiful bridges, 
             including the famous Magere Brug, a traditionally stylled lift <br> bridge. You can
             simply relax at a canalside caf√© and watch an array of boats float by, or 
             take a canal tour.
